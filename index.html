<h2> /ETHOS </h2>
<p> The Gold Rush wasn’t about gold, it was about property rights. </p>
<p> The Patent Boom wasn’t about patents, it was about invention rights. </p>
<p> The NFT Craze isn’t about NFTs, it is about creative rights. </p>
<p> People in power know this. It’s how they’ve used “land ownership” to exert control for thousands of years... but not this time. </p>
<p> This time it’s different. This time, we have the heart of the people and the strength to create new laws. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> /CREATIVE-RIGHTS </h2>
<p> NFTs are important because the rights and laws created around Intellectual Property (IP) will shape the future of digital assets. </p>
<p> They may seem like JPGs today, but tomorrow they will be Virtual Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). </p>
<p> This is why it is important that we, the creators, lead the way. </p>
<p> We will win the same way wars have been won by the righteous for thousands of years — being stronger together and taking action first. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> /NFT-IP </h2>
<p> Our <a href="https://worldartday2021.com" target="_blank"> #WorldArtDay2021 </a> experiment proved a point. That artists can use their abilities to inspire change in others and that we can rally around a shared belief. </p>
<p> This led me to 3 beliefs about NFT Intellectual Property for creators, of which we have already proven the first, the “right to collect” an NFT: </p>
<p> You need <b> 3 different spaces for NFTs: </b></p>
<p> 1. A space to admire it (collect) </p>
<p> 2. A space to make money with it (license) </p>
<p> 3. A space to set the rules (own) </p>

<p> Creators “own” all of the rights when they create an NFT. They can choose how and when to exercise all the rights that come with “ownership.” </p>
<p> Collectors, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders must be a part of the value network too. We need to provide them with a space to create value and profit off of it in a way that also respects the creator rights while providing them with a passive income stream. </p>
<p> To evolve this new system, we must experiment with the mechanics of it in the real world and use the results to earn the backing and legitimacy of intellectual institutions that can create change (i.e. @CreativeCommons, @ACLU, etc). </p>
<p> Which leads us into our second experiment... </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> /THIS-WAS-FOR </h2>
<p> The murder of Daunte Wright this week and the historic plight of African-Americans in the United States is our battle too. Our battle is for all allies — people that stand up against injustice irrespective of their race, religion, or resume. </p>
<p> On 4/20, a police officer was convicted for the murder of George Floyd, the Black brother whose death sparked an international movement in 2020. A woman standing by the hearing said this: </p>
<p> <i> "This is the first time we’ve convicted a cop in this state for murder, except for the one black cop. <b> This was for George, but this was for a lot of other people too."</b> </i> </p>
<p> This Was For... (thiswasfor.com / thiswasfor.org) is our opportunity as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs to inspire change, take action, and experiment with part 2/3 of NFT IP: </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> /THE-PLAN </h2>
<p> We will create a series of limited edition “This Was For...” Apparel (T-Shirts/Hoodies) and Prints "licensed" from relevant artwork via #WorldArtDay2021 and new #ThisWasFor art created by HEN artists. </p>
<p> The artwork will be related to one of the three themes: </p>
<p> --- </p>
<p> <b> This was for... </b> </p>
<p> <b> George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Daunte Wright... (Racial Rights) </b> </p>
<p> <b> Ross Ulbricht. Aaron Schwartz. Bruce Lee... (Internet Rights) </b> </p>
<p> <b> Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Dorothy Height. Almaas Elman... (Women’s Rights) </b> </p>
<p> --- </p>
<p> We will work with designers to create a series of 42 (4/20) Apparel & Print sets for each design and price them at 42 $XTZ ~$230 USD (still /TBD on pricing). </p>
<p> All participating artists will sign a short “contract” that we will create stating they provide thiswasfor.com the “license” to use their NFT/artwork in non-profit/for-profit ventures and in turn will receive 10% royalties on all sales. </p>
<p> <b> ^This </b> is how we test the 2nd part of our NFT IP system. That we can create a new way for others to “mix and match” the original NFTs in ventures, while artists still can make money from their creative work. </p>
<p> All “profits” will be donated to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/dauntewright" target="_blank"> Daunte Wright’s GoFundMe </a> </p>
<p> As a participating artist, you can choose if you’d like to keep the 10% royalties or donate it to Daunte’s GoFundMe. No judgement on either, but artists should have the “right” to decide. </p>
<p> (I am reaching out to apparel and print manufacturers in SF/LA to see if we can have the shirts/hoodies/prints donated. If so, this will increase the amount we can donate and help us lower the prices). </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> /NEXT-STEPS </h2>
<p> We need to move with speed and efficiency. It’s how we got #WorldArtDay2021 done and it’s how we will get this done. </p>
<br>
<h3> <b> 1. Be Informed </b></h3>
<p> If you don’t know who those 9 men and women are (among the many more), please do a quick Wikipedia search on them. </p>
<p> Breonna Taylor was a Black medical worker, shot dead in her own apartment by two police officers. </p>
<p> Aaron Schwartz was an internet hacktavist, founder of Reddit and the Creative Commons, fighting for the open internet we are creating today. </p>
<p> Almaas Elman was a Somali-Canadian human aid and women's rights worker who was shot dead by rebels in Somalia, 2019. </p>
<p> This was for... them. </p>
<br>
<h3> <b> 2. Consolidate Creatives </b></h3>
<p> Share this with allies who also believe in our values. It’s ok to keep this to yourself too. Things are accelerating and we cannot afford to be distracted by bad actors. </p>
<p> We need fashion designers that can take our artwork and integrate them into an aesthetic and style that people would love to wear in a T-Shirt / Hoodie. </p>
<p> If you have friends that are fashion designers or can execute on tech packs, etc, invite them to the Discord.</p> 
<p> This where my background founding ismbags.com is useful. I’ve learned how to manage a global supply chain for the production of a 7+ figure brand). </p>
<p> <b> <a href="https://discord.gg/GW4YMeVH" target="_blank"> WAD Discord Group </a> </b> </p>
<p> <b> <a href="https://t.me/jkwongism" target="_blank"> jkwong's Telegram </a> </b> </p>
<p> <b> <a href="https://twitter.com/thiswasfor" target="_blank"> @thiswasfor Twitter </a> </b> </p>
<p> <b> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/dauntewright" target="_blank"> Daunte Wright's GoFundMe </a> </b> </p>
<p> <b> <a href="https://worldartday2021.com" target="_blank"> #WorldArtDay2021 </a> </b> </p>
<p> <b> <a href="https://thiswasfor.com" target="_blank"> TWF Store (live 4/21 US Time) </a> </b> </p>
<br>
<h3> <b> 3. Create Art </b></h3>
<p> We need artwork that can be shown on the front of each t-shirt/hoodie that is symbolic of the three types of rights that we have been fighting for. Volunteer in the Discord channel if you can do this today (within the next 6 hours). </p>
<p> Jkwong and Kerim will also be reaching out to artists whose #WorldArtDay2021 artwork is relevant for this campaign and sharing a “NFT LICENSE IP” contract for them to “sign,” so that we can test a new licensing model. </p>
<br>
<h3> <b> 4. Send to TWF Gallery </b></h3>
<p> We will create a new gallery for “This was for...” and invite all participating artists to send their work to the gallery wallet (like WAD). </p>
<p> This time we will take the learnings from WAD to build on these ideas: </p>
<p> <b> i. Artist chooses how many editions they make / want to send </b> </p>
<p> <b> ii. Artist chooses what price they want each edition to be sold at (we “recommend <5 Tezos to make it accessible) </b></p>
<p> <b> iii. Artist receives all the “profit” from the sales of the OBJKTs, to be paid out daily/weekly (depending on logistics) </b></p>
<br>
<h3> <b> 5. Plan Marketing & Logistics </b></h3>
<p> We can build on our success promoting #WorldArtDay2021 on twitter, but with more “viral” campaigns that involve larger groups of stakeholders — Black Lives Matter, Civil Rights groups, Women’s Rights leaders of today. </p>
<p> We need artists to work with designers to share the asset files in formats that we can use to create apparel tech packs. </p>
<p> We need designers to work with manufacturers to proof samples and prepare for production. </p>
<p> We need marketers that can come up with and execute on creative “guerilla marketing” campaigns to spread the word. </p>
<br>
<h3> <b> 6. Launch Campaign </b> </h3>
<p> We don’t have much time to harness this zeitgeist, but if there is any group of people that can get this done it’s us. The plan is to launch the “store” on thiswasfor.com by 9am PT on Wednesday April 21st. </p>
<p> To do this, we need: </p>
<p> <b> i. All artwork proofed, contracts signed, and assets delivered by 3am PT on Wed 4/21 </b></p>
<p> <b> ii. All apparel created, proofed, and ready to print by 6am PT on Wed 4/21 </b></p> 
<p> <b> iii. All marketing campaigns finalized and executed on by 9am PT on Wed 4/21 </b></p>
<p> Doing this well will enable us to maximize our momentum for the third and final part of NFT IP, “ownership” (3/3). The plan is to complete all 3/3 NFT IP experiments before May 1st, when #WorldArtDay2021 comes to an end. </p>
